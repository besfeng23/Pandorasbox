Perfect — if you already stored the **stabilization_sprint_plan** in Cursor/repo, then you’re past the “create the file” step ✅ Now you just need to **publish it into Kairos (Base44)** and **make Kairos actually use it**.

Here’s the exact “what now” checklist (no questions, just actions):

---

## ✅ 1) Verify the file is really in the repo

Make sure this exists (or equivalent path):

* `contracts/kairos/stabilization_sprint_plan.json`

If it’s there, good. Move on.

---

## ✅ 2) Add a publish script (so you can push it to Base44 Kairos)

Even if the plan exists locally, Kairos won’t know it unless you send it.

Create:

* `scripts/kairos-register-stabilization.ts`

It should:

* read the JSON file
* POST to: `https://kairostrack.base44.app/api/stabilization/register` (or your actual endpoint)
* include auth header if you use one

Add npm script:

* `"kairos:register:stabilization": "tsx scripts/kairos-register-stabilization.ts"`

Then run:

```bash
npm run kairos:register:stabilization
```

---

## ✅ 3) Implement the Base44 endpoints + storage (if not already done)

Kairos needs these, otherwise your POST won’t land:

### Storage

* `kairos_stabilization_plans` table/collection

  * `id`, `created_at`, `source`, `is_active`, `plan_json`

### APIs

* `POST /api/stabilization/register`
* `GET /api/stabilization/active`

---

## ✅ 4) Wire stabilization into rollups as a gating overlay

This is the “it actually matters” step.

During rollup recompute:

* load active masterplan
* load active stabilization plan
* apply gating:

  * mark impacted tasks `blocked` if gates fail
  * do **not** count stabilization as progress
  * stabilization only affects *status/eligibility* and denominator rules (per your formulas)

---

## ✅ 5) Add the UI banner so you *see* it

In Kairos Overview:

* “Stabilization Sprint” banner
* show:

  * open P0/P1 count (or “unknown” until bug events exist)
  * top root-cause clusters
  * current gate status (pass/fail)

---

## ✅ 6) Then run a single end-to-end proof test

1. Register masterplan (already done ✅)
2. Register stabilization plan (this step)
3. Run `npm run kairos:simulate`
4. Confirm in Kairos:

   * Live Activity shows events
   * Tasks reflect gating (blocked where appropriate)

---

### The key point 🧠

**Having it “stored in Cursor” only means it’s in your repo.**
To make it real, you must:
✅ **publish it to Kairos** + ✅ **wire Kairos rollups/UI to read it**.

If you want the fastest next move: tell Cursor to implement steps **2–5** exactly (publish script + Base44 endpoints + gating overlay + banner).
