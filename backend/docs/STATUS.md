## Overall
- **Completion**: 93%

## Checks
- **Policy**: Kairos does not run `typecheck/lint/test` by default.
- **Opt-in**: set `KAIROS_RUN_CHECKS=1` to include summarized check results in `docs/status.json` only.

## Top Risks
- **Potential Firestore rules coverage gaps** (high): Collections referenced in code but not matched by an explicit rules stanza: learning_queue.
- **Hardcoded email defaults present** (high): Detected hardcoded emails in code paths (example(s): user@example.com in public/openapi-mcp.json; user@example.com in public/openapi-mcp.yaml; joven.ong23@gmail.com in src/app/api/chatgpt/hybrid-retrieve/route.ts). Risk: portability + privacy. Follow-up: move to DEFAULT_CHATGPT_USER_EMAIL env var.
- **Hardcoded URLs/endpoints present** (medium): Detected hardcoded URL(s) in code or OpenAPI (example(s): http://localhost:9002 in public/openapi-mcp.json; http://localhost:9002 in public/openapi-mcp.yaml; https://studio-sg--seismic-vista-480710-q5.asia-southeast1.hosted.app in src/app/api/chatgpt/openapi.yaml). Risk: environment drift across dev/stage/prod.
