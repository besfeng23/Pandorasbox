# Cursor AI Rules - Auto-Commit After Changes

## Automatic Workflow

After making ANY file changes, automatically:
1. Stage all changes: `git add -A`
2. Commit with timestamp: `git commit -m "Auto-commit: [timestamp] - [files]"`
3. Push to GitHub: `git push origin HEAD`
4. Send events to Kairos: `npm run kairos:production-fixes`

## Implementation

After completing any task or making file edits, immediately run:
```bash
npm run auto-commit
```

This ensures:
- ✅ All changes are tracked in git
- ✅ All changes are pushed to GitHub
- ✅ All changes are tracked in Kairos
- ✅ No manual intervention needed

## Important

**NEVER skip this step.** Every change must be committed, pushed, and tracked.
